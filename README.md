# Neural-Networks
A Fully connected FF BP Neural Network Library built from Ground up using vanilla Python
The library has been built for a multi layer perceptron and the structure of the network can be tweaked 
by modifying the json file under data/NNStructure.txt

A command line parser has been built to invoke the deep learning framework under parser/cli_parser.py 

All the activation functions are kept in activation/

The Utils contains static methods for creation of zero and ones matrices.

The Weight folder has a initialized set of weights for testing.

The Error folder has custom defined Errors.


Lastly, the algo folder has the core algorithm and optimisers execution under algo/train and algo/score.
